            Thank you for coming. In this talk I’ll be sharing our journey creating and releasing sqlserver-sequence, some unexpected pitfalls, and different ways of giving back to the community.

            So sqlserver-sequence was published in July. It was our first open-source project on RubyGems.org. Since then it’s enjoyed around a thousand downloads.
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h4>Basic Usage</h4>
<pre>
<code data-trim data-noescape>
class Checkout < ActiveRecord::Base
  sequence :order_id
end
</code>
<code data-trim data-noescape class='fragment'>
$ checkout = Checkout.create
$ checkout.order_id
> 1
</code>
<code data-trim data-noescape class='fragment'>
$ other_checkout = Checkout.create
$ other_checkout.order_id
> 2  
</code>
</pre>
          <aside class='notes'>
            <p>
              The gem is pretty straightforward and easy to use. Let's assume we have a checkout model with a sequence defined on its order_id column. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When the checkout is created order_id should receive the next value for that sequence defined in SQL Server. 
            </p>
            <p>
              And if I create another checkout it receives the next sequence value and so on.
            </p>
          </aside>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Options</h4>
<pre>
<code data-trim data-noescape>
class Checkout < ActiveRecord::Base
  sequence :order_id<mark class='fragment'>, name: 'contract_id'</mark><mark class='fragment'>,
                      prefix: 'CT-'</mark><mark class='fragment'>,
                      format: lambda { |n| n.rjust(8, 0) }</mark>
end
</code>
<code data-trim data-noescape class='fragment'>
$ checkout = Checkout.create
$ checkout.order_id
> "CT-00000001" # generated by sequence named 'contract_id'
</code>
<code data-trim data-noescape class='fragment'>
$ other_checkout = Checkout.create
$ other_checkout.order_id
> "CT-00000002"
</code>
</pre>

          <aside class='notes'>
            <p>
              There are also options to map to a sequence named differently than your attribute. 
            </p>
            <p>
              You can assign a prefix to the beginning of the sequence.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if you need more control of the sequence format you can pass in lambda expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              What you end up with is a sequence value that matches something like contract numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if I create another checkout it receives the next available contract number.
            </p>

            So that's sqlserver-sequence in a nutshell. Let's begin the journey of seeing what went into building this gem.

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <aside class='notes'>
            Well the first thing we had to do was research existing solutions. One of the wonderful benefits of an open-source community is people sharing solutions to common problems. We certainly don't want to reinvent the wheel.

            <aside class='notes'>
              There were several interesting gems that provided sequence generation in Rails. There was even sequence support within ActiveRecord itself, but none of the gems really fit our use case and patching them was impractical.

              However I did notice some patterns in terms of interface design and these ideas would later influence our own interface. Plus it's just cool being able to see how these popular gems work under the hood and you learn a lot of great techniques for improving your own code.

            <aside class='notes'>
              So I was struggling trying to find a unique name, and instead did a quick search on Rubygems for 'Sequence'. I remembered our mogoid-sequence gem from earlier, liked its format, and said ok, how about sqlserver-sequence?

            <aside class='notes'>
              Also should it be a hyphen, underscore, PascalCase? Thankfully Rubygems provides naming guidelines for the community so there's no confusion when to use a hyphen, when to use an underscore, etc.

               Also it's worth putting even greater emphasis on variable and method names. You want others to contribute and that's much easier when the code is easy to understand. It also encourages those who contribute to exhibit the same care for quality.

              Perhaps the greatest value you can provide in your documentation are examples of how to use gem. Sadly people could care less about what's going on inside your beautiful code base. What they want to know first is how can I use this gem and does it really solve my problem. Think about your own experience evaluating gems and keep this in mind while crafting documentation.

              For example what happens when I break from conventions. What are some of the other options I can use and what are the side effects?

              Finally always include a section on Contributing. Everyone has their own policy for contributing and developers will want to know how you accept contributions. Bundler automatically includes a contributing section based on standard git flow, which is what the majority of the open-source community follows anyhow.

              Another great way to drive adoption is to include badges in your repository. These add another layer of polish and professionalism and could sway developers towards your gem.
